== RabbitMQ Demo

Just a simple use case with enough "security" to show case something more "realistic".

== Usage

Get https://github.com/a-inacio/self-signed-certificates[some certificates] into `data/certificates`.
Run `docker compose up`.

== TODO

Check and document an health check to the broker. e.g.:

.docker-compose.yml
[source,yml]
---
#...
healthcheck:
  test: ["CMD-SHELL", "rabbitmq-diagnostics -q ping"]
  interval: 30s
  timeout: 10s
  retries: 10
